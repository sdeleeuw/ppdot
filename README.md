ppdot
=====

ppdot is a simple Graphviz pre-processor written in Python.

Graphviz is a great tool for automatic diagram creation from a plain text
representation of data. I use this tool regularly to draw flowchart and UML
diagrams, mainly because it is quick and easy to write and update. However,
it often requires a lot of duplicate statements to create visually appealing
graphs. ppdot tries to solve this with a number of pre-processing features:

* include : include data from other files;
* define  : C-style macros (search-and-replace);
* style   : a more powerful way to create attribute sets.

ppdot also include a carefully selected set of macros and styles.

(this documentation is a work in progress ...)
